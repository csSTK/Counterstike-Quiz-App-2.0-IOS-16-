# Counter-Strike Quiz App
The Counter-Strike Quiz App is an interactive trivia game designed for fans of the popular Counter-Strike video game series. This app challenges players with questions about Counter-Strike's history,
gameplay mechanics, and iconic elements, such as maps, weapons, and characters.

This project was developed as a learning exercise in Swift, focusing on core iOS development principles, such as UIKit, navigation, and state management.

## Goals
The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of Swift and iOS development by working on:
Building UI components programmatically and with Storyboards.
Managing application states and user inputs.
Creating a robust navigation flow.
Parsing and displaying data dynamically.

## Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/csSTK/Counterstike-Quiz-App-2.0-IOS-16-.git
```
Open the project in Xcode.
Run the app on the iOS Simulator or a physical device.
